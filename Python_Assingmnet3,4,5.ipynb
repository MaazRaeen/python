    "In Python, you can achieve similar behavior using different conventions or techniques. Here are some approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Convention: Python doesn't enforce restrictions like Java does with final, but you can use naming conventions to indicate that certain attributes or methods should not be overridden or modified. Prefixing such attributes or methods with an underscore (_) can signal to other developers that they are not intended for modification.\n",

    "Using Properties and Descriptors: You can use properties and descriptors to control access to attributes, effectively making them read-only or preventing modification after initialization.\n",

    "File handling in Python refers to the process of working with files on the filesystem. Python provides several built-in functions and methods for performing various operations on files, such as reading, writing, appending, and closing files. Here's an overview of the main concepts and functionalities related to file handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Opening Files: Before performing any operation on a file, you need to open it. Python provides the built-in open() function for this purpose. It takes the file path and the mode in which you want to open the file as parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. File Modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "'r': Open a file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "'w': Open a file for writing. If the file already exists, it truncates the file to zero length. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file.\n",
    "'a': Open a file for appending. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.\n",
    "'b': (Optional) Used in conjunction with other file modes to open a file in binary mode.\n",
    "'+': (Optional) Open a file for both reading and writing (updating). The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Closing Files: It's important to close files after you finish working with them to release system resources. You can close files using the close() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reading Files: Once a file is opened for reading, you can read its contents using various methods such as read(), readline(), or readlines().\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Writing to Files: Once a file is opened for writing, you can write data to it using the write() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Appending to Files: Similar to writing, appending allows you to add data to the end of an existing file."

    "Advantages of using NumPy for sorting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficiency: NumPy is implemented in C, which makes it significantly faster than pure Python implementations for many operations, including sorting. NumPy uses highly optimized algorithms and memory layouts for sorting, resulting in improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Convenience: NumPy provides a variety of sorting functions and methods, such as np.sort(), np.argsort(), and np.lexsort(), which offer flexibility and convenience for different sorting needs. These functions support sorting along specific axes, sorting with custom comparison functions, and sorting based on multiple keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Integration with other NumPy operations: NumPy arrays can be seamlessly integrated with other NumPy operations, such as mathematical operations, slicing, and filtering. This allows for efficient data manipulation and analysis workflows where sorting is just one step among many.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Memory efficiency: NumPy arrays are stored in contiguous memory blocks, which allows for efficient memory access and manipulation. Sorting NumPy arrays is memory-efficient and does not require additional memory allocation for temporary arrays or intermediate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Broadcasting: NumPy supports broadcasting, which allows for element-wise operations between arrays of different shapes and sizes. This enables sorting operations on arrays with complex shapes and dimensions, making NumPy suitable for a wide range of data analysis tasks."
